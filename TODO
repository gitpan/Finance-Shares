change process_log to summerize by weeks
should function handlers automatically determine dest graph, as CGI::process_graph?

Overview
    3rd way? using fs_model script with model specs
    Depreciate CGI

Model
    eq etc should have a margin of error
    summary chart with functions for highest, average and lowest values for all samples
    add XOR test

Sample
    line data would be better stored as $s->{prices}{lines}{id}... instead of $s->{lines}{prices}{id}...
    sample by alldays and weekdays too, to handle gaps in yahoo's data

Bands
    'shown' should allow high/low/both/none.

MySQL
    collect failed requests; failed() returns and clears list
    +script to re-fetch failed requests
    mode = 'fetch' for fetch anyway; and 'local' for fetch if not here

Chart
    order required for drawing lines and Key entries (not 587++)
    support for N-up output: prices graph optional, heading on first graph, left/right/top/bottom settings
    
Key
    Line height calculations assume 1 icon per text; not true when wrapped
    Font settings should be sub-hashes with name/size/color

Paper
    ps_functions xdrawstock belongs in Chart::ps_functions
    bar mid-lines should be minor and optional

Style
    There should be a 'no edge' option for lines as well as points, to prevent double-drawing slowness
    'outer_width' should be consistent across bars, lines and shapes

Trends
    seperate rising/falling trends
    give date -> return which trend line or undef
    Not realistic lines - overhaul required
    e.g. include error range for slopes that count

admin
    script to delete user (and all lines in all tables with that userid)

init.pl
    Chart: background colour, graph percentages
    Style: add x_offset, y_offset

menu.pl
    add 'change user settings' page
    add login option (needs top level redirect from login.pl)
    
interface.pl
    truncate history if it gets too long?
    remember last name visited on each page?
    add user-specific stock names?
    validation not working! (needs to be done in JavaScript)
    '<< Click this' msg if no list
    functions: no 'Submit' unless Function chosen

chart.pl
    Chart 'width' and 'edge contrast' should apply to Volume bars too.
    Cannot output more than one Sample
    process_fnline doesn't check for circular refs.
    Draw signals last so they are always on top


packages
    UPDATE PROCESS
    	For each module,
    *	    main version changed (needs repackaging)
    v	    diff each with their last versions to establish version numbers.
    	For each module,
    u	    update 'use' dependencies and copy into packages.
    d	    check through pod documentation
	For each package,
    r	    check README, installation instructions etc.
    m	    check MANIFEST and Makefile.PL; do 'make'
    t	    do 'make test'
    s	    run any other test scripts
    b	    bundle as tarball ('make dist')
    i	    installation from tarball checked
