# The smallest working model would be something like:
#
#   source => 't/01-shell.csv'
#
# and would need the stock code given on the command line:
#
#   fs_model -m model/mimimal SHEL.L
#
# But this is hardly very useful.  Probably the smallest useful model would
# access the database/internet to show quotes for a single stock.
# This example assumes you have a mysql database set up for the Lessons
# as outlined in Finance::Shares::Overview.

source => {
    user     => 'test',
    password => 'test',
    database => 'test',
},

sample => {
    start_date => '2003-01-01',
},

# Use this as e.g.
#
#   fs_model -m model/minimal -s MSFT
