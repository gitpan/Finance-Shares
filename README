Finance::Shares
===============

This collection of modules provides a toolkit for developing
stock market strategies.  There is an introduction,
Finance::Shares::Overview and a tutorial introducing the
modules, starting with Finance::Shares::Lesson1.


INSTALLATION
============

To install this module type the following:

    perl Makefile.PL
    make
    make test
    make install


DEPENDENCIES
============

In addition to the standard perl distribution, these others
are also required.  They can all be found on CPAN
(http://www.cpan.org)

    Test::More
    Date::Calc
    Text::CSV_XS
    LWP::UserAgent
    DBIx::Namespace 0.03
    PostScript::File 0.12
    PostScript::Graph 0.13


ADDITIONAL FILES
================

A number of support scripts are provided in the package.  As
they are principally used in development they are not
installed.

fs_list_tables
    Shows the mapping between DBIx::Namespace names and
    their underlying mysql tables.  Change the script so
    that it matches your database (it assumes 'test').  
    Use as:

	fs_list_tables
	fs_list_tables Known::Family

fs_drop_table
    Use this to drop a table used by DBIx::Namespace as it
    keeps the index synchronized.  Change the script so
    that it matches your database (it assumes 'test').  
    Use as:

	fs_drop_table Known::Family::Table

fs_fetch
    A script to fetch quotes from the internet.  It assumes
    the mysql database has been set up correctly.  See
    Finance::Shares::MySQL.  Try:

	fs_fetch --help

fs_fetch_csv
    This also fetches quotes from the internet, but it can
    also fetch cached quotes and save them as a CSV file.
    Try:
    
	fs_fetch_csv --help

fs_reset_size
    Used in conjunction with the t/*.t tests.  The size of
    the output files are monitored as a quick check whether
    the chart has changed.  Once you have inspected the
    charts and are happy with them, this script will update
    the tests with the new file sizes.  Use as:

	$ fs_reset_size t/*.t

TestFuncs.pm
    This module is only used by the t/*.t tests.
