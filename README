Finance::Shares
===============

This collection of modules provides a toolkit for developing stock market
strategies.  There is an introduction, Finance::Shares::Overview and a tutorial
introducing the modules, starting with Finance::Shares::Lesson1.


INSTALLATION
============

To install this module type the following:

    perl Makefile.PL
    make
    make test
    make install


DEPENDENCIES
============

In addition to the standard perl distribution, these others are also required.
They can all be found on CPAN (http://www.cpan.org)

    Test::More
    Date::Calc
    Text::CSV_XS
    LWP::UserAgent
    DBIx::Namespace   0.03
    PostScript::File  1.00
    PostScript::Graph 1.00


ADDITIONAL FILES
================

A number of support scripts are provided although only fs_model and fs_fetch are
installed.

fs_model
    This is the main script in this package and the only one installed to your
    system.  By setting up a suitable specifications file, any number of stocks
    can be put through the same treatment.  The resulting charts can be stored
    as a single PostScript file or as individual files.  It has its own man
    page, but see also Finance::Shares::Model.  Try:
    
	man fs_model
	fs_model --model=model/01-multiple
	fs_model --model=model/05-minimal --stocks=stock/misc3

fs_list_tables
    Shows the mapping between DBIx::Namespace names and their underlying mysql
    tables.  Change the script so that it matches your database (it assumes
    'test').  Use as:

	fs_list_tables
	fs_list_tables Known::Family

fs_drop_table
    Use this to drop a table used by DBIx::Namespace as it keeps the index
    synchronized.  Change the script so that it matches your database (it
    assumes 'test').  Use as:

	fs_drop_table Known::Family::Table

fs_fetch
    A script to fetch quotes from the internet.  It assumes the mysql database
    has been set up correctly.  See Finance::Shares::MySQL.  Try:

	fs_fetch --help
	fs_fetch --start '2003-01-01' MSFT HPQ

    Note that the start and end dates now have useful defaults (which also apply
    to fs_model and fs_fetch_csv).  'end' defaults to today.  'start' defaults
    to the day after the last date in the database, or fetches the last few
    days.

fs_fetch_csv
    This also fetches quotes from the internet, but it can also fetch cached
    quotes and save them as a CSV file.  Try:
    
	fs_fetch_csv --help
	fs_fetch_csv --stocks=stock/misc3

fs_reset_size
    Used in conjunction with the t/*.t tests.  The size of the output files are
    monitored as a quick check whether the chart has changed.  Once you have
    inspected the charts and are happy with them, this script will update the
    tests with the new file sizes.  Use as:

	$ fs_reset_size t/*.t

TestFuncs.pm
    This module is only used by the t/*.t tests.
