PREPARATION
===========

It is assumed you have an internet connection.  A package that fetches quotes
from !Yahoo won't be much use to you without one.  You will also need mysql.

Installation should work without mysql being set up because the tests will just
be skipped.  If you wish to try out the software, you will have to set up your
mysql server anyway, so why not do it now?

To set up the necessary mysql permissions, as root, log on to mysql and give any
password requested (just press return if you haven't set one up):

    root@here# mysql -u root -p
    Password:

Within B<mysql> declare that user 'test' is allowed to access the 'test'
database using the password 'test'.  This is what the tests expect.

    mysql> grant all privileges on "test".* to "test"
	   identified by "test";

You might like to add a real user while your at it.


DEPENDENCIES
============

In addition to the standard perl distribution, these others are also required.
They can all be found on CPAN (http://www.cpan.org)

    Pod::Usage
    Test::More
    Date::Calc
    Text::CSV_XS
    LWP::UserAgent
    DBIx::Namespace   0.04
    PostScript::File  1.01
    PostScript::Graph 1.01


INSTALLATION
============

If you have set up the mysql test database, please make sure an internet
connection is available as some of the tests will fetch quotes.

To install this module type the following:

    perl Makefile.PL
    make
    make test
    make install


ADDITIONAL FILES
================

This is the main script in this package and the only one installed to your
system.  

fsmodel
    By setting up a suitable specifications file, any number of stocks
    can be put through the same treatment.  The resulting charts can be stored
    as a single PostScript file or as individual files.  It has its own man
    page, but see also Finance::S0::Model.
    
    Examples
    
	man fsmodel
	fsmodel --help

    [Assuming:
    (a)	mysql has been set up as in PREPARATION above;
    (b)	there is an open internet connection;
    (c)	'models/default.conf' has been copied to '~/.fs/default.conf;
    then these commands may be given from the distribution top level directory,
    producing *.ps files as their output.]

	fsmodel --model=models/greater MSFT
	fsmodel --model=models/less --file=less GSK.L AZN.L
	fsmodel -m models/compare -s stocks/FTSE-media -f media
	fsmodel -m models/convergence -s stocks/FTSE-mining -v 3


These two utilities are included as they support low level access to the mysql
database.  They are not installed; copy them to a bin directory if required.

fs_list_tables
    Shows the mapping between DBIx::Namespace names and their underlying mysql
    tables.  Change the script so that it matches your database (it assumes
    'test').  Use as:

	fs_list_tables
	fs_list_tables Known::Family

fs_drop_table
    Use this to drop a table used by DBIx::Namespace as it keeps the index
    synchronized.  Change the script so that it matches your database (it
    assumes 'test').  Use as:

	fs_drop_table Known::Family::Table
