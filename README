Finance::Shares 0.91
====================

This collection of modules provides a toolkit for developing stock market
strategies.  There is an introduction, Finance::Shares::Overview and a tutorial
introducing the modules, starting with Finance::Shares::Lesson1.

As indicated by the version number, this suite is near a major version change.
Most development work now is on version 1.


INSTALLATION
============

To install this module type the following:

    perl Makefile.PL
    make
    make test
    make install


DEPENDENCIES
============

In addition to the standard perl distribution, these others are also required.
They can all be found on CPAN (http://www.cpan.org)

    Pod::Usage
    Test::More
    Date::Calc
    Text::CSV_XS
    LWP::UserAgent
    DBIx::Namespace   0.03
    PostScript::File  1.00
    PostScript::Graph 1.00


ADDITIONAL FILES
================

A number of support scripts are provided although only fs_model and fs_fetch are
installed.

fs_model
    This is the main script in this package and the only one installed to your
    system.  By setting up a suitable specifications file, any number of stocks
    can be put through the same treatment.  The resulting charts can be stored
    as a single PostScript file or as individual files.  It has its own man
    page, but see also Finance::Shares::Model.  Try:
    
	man fs_model
	fs_model --help
	fs_model --model=model/multiple
	fs_model --model=model/minimal --codes=stock/misc3

fs_fetch
    A script to fetch quotes from the internet.  It assumes the mysql database
    has been set up correctly.  See Finance::Shares::MySQL.  Try:

	fs_fetch --help
	fs_fetch --start '2003-01-01' MSFT HPQ

    Note that the start and end dates now have useful defaults (which also apply
    to fs_model and fs_fetch_csv).  'end' defaults to today.  'start' defaults
    to the day after the last date in the database, or fetches the last few
    days.

fs_fetch_csv
    This also fetches quotes from the internet, but it can also fetch cached
    quotes and save them as a CSV file.  Try:
    
	fs_fetch_csv --help
	fs_fetch_csv --stocks=stock/misc3

fs_list_tables
    Shows the mapping between DBIx::Namespace names and their underlying mysql
    tables.  Change the script so that it matches your database (it assumes
    'test').  Use as:

	fs_list_tables
	fs_list_tables Known::Family

fs_drop_table
    Use this to drop a table used by DBIx::Namespace as it keeps the index
    synchronized.  Change the script so that it matches your database (it
    assumes 'test').  Use as:

	fs_drop_table Known::Family::Table

[fs_reset_size has been dropped - running the test twice resets the file
size error.]

TestFuncs.pm
    This module is only used by the t/*.t tests.
